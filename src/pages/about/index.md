### The beginnings (1993)

My first contact with TTRPGs was through my friend. We were both fans of _Talisman_, a popular boardgame called in Poland _Magia i Miecz_ (Magic and the Sword). So when his older brother bought a magazine called _Magia i Miecz_ it caught our attention. _Magia i Miecz_ though touched a topic of totally different type of games as I have learned - tabletop role playing games. The first issue I bought had a whole TTRPG game described on dozen of pages - it was _Oko Yrrhedesa_ (The Eye of Yrrhedes) and was authored by no one else than Andrzej Sapkowski, the author of The Witcher saga.

With noone around to teach us, I have read carefully the game description couple of times and game mastered my first session to couple of my friends.

### The everyday (1994-1999)

After that I've started running games on _Kryształy Czasu_ (Crystals of Time) by Artur Szyndler which was published in parts in Magia i Miecz. It was times when none of the RPG games was published yet in Poland. But that was about to change.

Friend of mine bought translation of _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_ 1st edition and run several games for us. Another bought the translation of _Cyberpunk 2020_ and run couple of sessions too. And I have bought the translation of _Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2ed_ which became my main RPG for couple of years.

### The disaster (2000-2006)

But as we aged we changed schools, got girlfriends, started universities and our paths started to diverege. So did our games.

I had some occasional games, but very infrequent. My love for RPGs didn't fade, but turned more into collecting them, so I have added to my shelves _Earthdawn_, _Monastyr_ (polish dark fantasy game), _Neuroshima_ (polish post-apocalyptic game), _Dungeons & Dragons 3.5_, _Call of Cthulhu 5ed_, _Dzikie Pola_ (polish game set in 16th-18th century in Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine).

### Little comeback (2007-2009)

University finished, relationship broken, I have decided to come back to tabletop RPGs. A guy I met on a random RPG game introduced me to the group of RPG and LARP fans collected in _Trójmiejska Inicjatywa RPGowa_ (Tricity RPG Initiative). Apart of participating in nerd parties they organised, urbex explorations and LARP conventions, it gave me chance to sit again at the table as a game master. I did run some short campaigns of _Monastyr_ and _Call of Cthulhu_, as well as increased my collection with games like _Klanarchia_ (polish dark fantasy), _Burning Wheel Revised_, _Savage Worlds_, _Midnight_ setting for D&D.
